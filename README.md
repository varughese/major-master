# Contributing (Read this)
First pick a GitHub card to do. (Projects tab > Major Master > Pick a card). You have to make a new branch before you can make changes. You should make a new branch that corresponds to this project card. Follow these in your command line. 

```
git checkout -b name_of_your_branch
```

Make your changes in that branch. Make commits and stuff as normal. When you are finished your Trello assignment, make sure everything is commited and push it.

```
git push origin name_of_your_branch
